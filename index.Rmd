# Prerequisites

Some basic knowlege about the R lanuage is requred.

It would be helpful if you have some basic knowlege about HTML, CSS and javascript, but they are not required.

## Softwares
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Better to use the latest version of R (3.3.0 for the time this tutorial is written).
- [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). A user friendly IDE for R. Very convenient tool in building shiny apps.
- Web browser. Better to use google chrome or firefox.

## R packages
- `shiny`
- `shinydashboard`
- `plotly`

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
